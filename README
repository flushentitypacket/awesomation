Awesomation is a heroku-compatible web server that powers a HomeRemote Wireless Home Automation Gateway.
The Gateway (model HRGZ1) is available at Amazon.com: http://amzn.to/gBnjKa for $99.99 (as of Nov 23, 2010).

Awesomation was built by reverse engineering the HRGZ1's native web interface, determining the web requests that invoke the various automation calls, and recreating those requests from a remote, public-facing server (Awesomation on heroku). It is accurate as of firmware revision 0.5200.

Awesomation requires the following environment variables to be set:

- GATEWAY_HOST
  Hostname or IP address of HRWHA Gateway. Must be publicly accessible.
- GATEWAY_PORT
  TCP port for accessing the HRWHA Gateway admin panel.
- GATEWAY_USERNAME
  Username for accessing HRWHA Gateway. Should be an email address.
- GATEWAY_PASSWORD
  Password for accessing HRWHA Gateway.

Awesomation makes use of the following optional environment variables, if they are set:

- BASICAUTH_USERNAME
  Username to use for HTTP Basic Auth when making action calls to Awesomation.
- BASICAUTH_PASSWORD
  Password to use for HTTP Basic Auth when making action calls to Awesomation.

For bash (development), use "export KEY=value"
For heroku (production), use "heroku config:add KEY=value"
